# Yavuzlar-Frontend
 Yavuzlar software team front-end weekly tasks.
# Week 1
 JavaScript basics, data structures, functions, objects, DOM and algorithm exercises. I've added comments to each code block.

# Week 2
 I've built a 'wordle-like' game which you try to guess the word letter by letter. I gained experience with Localstorage, JSON parsing & stringify, debugging, DOM and error handling topics.
